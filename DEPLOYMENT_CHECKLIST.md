### 3. Discord Bot Setup
- [ ] Bot token generated and ready
- [ ] Bot invited to server with proper permissions
- [ ] Slash commands registered
- [ ] Guild ID and Channel IDs confirmed

### 4. Railway Deployment Steps
1. [ ] Push code to GitHub repository
2. [ ] Connect repository to Railway
3. [ ] Set all environment variables
4. [ ] Deploy and monitor logs
5. [ ] Test health check endpoint
6. [ ] Verify bot is online in Discord

## üîß Health Check Endpoints

- **Health Check**: `GET /health` - Returns bot status and system info
- **Root**: `GET /` - Returns basic bot information

## üìä Monitoring

- Check Railway logs for deployment status
- Monitor Discord for bot responses
- Use Railway metrics for performance monitoring
- Health check endpoint for uptime monitoring

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Bot not responding**: Check Discord token and permissions
2. **Health check failing**: Verify PORT environment variable
3. **Build errors**: Check TypeScript compilation
4. **Data not persisting**: Verify data directory permissions

### Debug Commands:
```bash
# Check bot status
curl https://your-railway-url.railway.app/health

# View logs
railway logs

# Check environment variables
railway variables
```
